# Scroll of Summon Us!  
This is a mod for Baldur's Gate 3, it adds the above aforementioned scroll to the game. Do we really need more of a description? Fine, it let's you Summon Us! The cute little Intellect Devourer we all know and love. **SUMMON US! YOU MUST DO IT!**  
  
# Hey! This isn't an *official* D&D 5E item!!  
We know!  
# Then...why did you make this?  
Because we are us! You must summon us! **YOU MUST! DO IT! SUMMON US!**  
# Installation Instructions  
It's recommended to use  [BG3 Mod Manager](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager), you can find the latest release  [HERE](https://github.com/LaughingLeader/BG3ModManager/releases).  
1.  Open BG3ModManager, and drag-and-drop the Zip file onto the window  
2.  The mod should appear as "Whiskeymancy" in the 'Inactive Mods' list, right-click and select 'Allow in Load Order'  
3.  In the top menu-bar, click:  
4.  File ➡ Save Order (Ctrl+S)  
5.  File ➡ Export Order to Game (Ctrl+E)  
  
I don't recommended installing it manually, I wouldn't try to do that and I'm the one that made this mod!
